> > The present study uses a novel network analysis approach, namely network outcome analysis21 , to examine predictive associations between a range of different psychological factors and the development of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. A crucial benefit of network analysis concerns the separation of direct effects (for example, edge between impulsivity and suicidal ideation) and indirect effects (for example, association between impulsivity and suicidal ideation through other cognitions)21 . Based on prior research, we predicted that hopelessness, burdensomeness, lack of belongingness, entrapment, and identification with death would be the strongest proximate predictors of suicide-related outcomes.

> > The study complies with all ethical regulations and received ethical approval (number 2014P001620/MGH) from Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Patients presenting due to severe psychiatric distress to the Massachusetts General Hospital Emergency Department (ED) (between February 2015 and March 2017) were approached by study research assistants. Reasons for not obtaining informed consent included impairment due to psychiatric complaints, discharge, refusal to participate, language barriers and various other reasons. To be included in the study, participants had to be adults (18 years or older; no upper age limit), have presented at the Acute Psychiatry Service, and have had access to a phone or email over the 6-month follow-up period. Exclusion criteria encompassed any condition that hinders an individual’s capacity to provide informed consent and participate in the study, including (1) the inability to speak or read English, (2) severe cognitive impairments due to conditions, such as florid psychosis, intellectual disability, dementia, and acute intoxication, or (3) the presence of extremely agitated or violent behavior. The attending psychiatrist on duty determined the applicability of these criteria, with the primary focus being the safety of both participants and research staff. Participants could receive a total compensation of $30 for completing the in-person session and two follow-up surveys ($10 for each), along with additional benefits such as parking and cafeteria vouchers.

 > After obtaining written informed consent, the baseline visit while in the emergency room included an evaluation from the treating clinician, brief clinical self-report measures (administered through a tablet), and the completion of a brief implicit association test. There were two follow-up surveys conducted over the telephone or email, one month and six months after the baseline visit. The study, sample, and enrollment procedures are described in more detail elsewhere. The data supporting this study are not publicly available due to their highly sensitive nature.
