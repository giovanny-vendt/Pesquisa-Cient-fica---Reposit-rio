> > First, we aim to establish the relationship between loneliness, rumination and depression using their total scores to confirm the mediation effects of rumination, in line with previous research. Second, to achieve a more in-depth understanding of the relationship, we will construct a network of loneliness and depressive symptoms and a network of loneliness, rumination and depressive symptoms using more specific items

> > Our two major hypotheses were satisfied by the study. First, in the mediation model, rumination indeed mediated the relationship between loneliness and depression. Our second hypothesis was also satisfied. In the loneliness–depression network, the present study did not reveal stable bridge symptoms due to the poor reliability of the bridge centrality indices. The instability of the loneliness–depression only network means that the two constructs are not the whole picture.
