> É consenso na literatura que o isolamento social e solidão aumentam a mortalidade através de fatores de risco a saúde como obesidade, consumo de álcool e tabagismo, por exemplo. Uma das estratégias para mitigar esses efeitos é a prática de atividades físicas, que tem fator protetor na qualidade de vida e saúde mental do indivíduo

> > We studied a community-based cohort of 317 healthy young adults aged 18–28 years (57.09% females), recruited from September 2014 to November 2018, for 7 days during everyday life (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We further studied a replication sample of 30 healthy adults aged 18–63 years, recruited from December 2019 to July 2022, for 6 months during everyday life during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany (Supplementary Table 7). The biological sex of participants was determined using a questionnaire

> > The physical activity of individuals (Fig. 1 and Table 1) significantly moderated the known relationship 2 between momentary social isolation and decreased affective valence in everyday life (β = 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0–0.02; P = 0.020; Supplementary Table 2). Specifically, higher physical activity significantly decreased the reduction in affective well-being associated with the lack of social contact (Fig. 2a–c). According to our data, about 349 milli-g (g/1,000) physical activity across 1 h (for example, walking approximately three miles per hour) are necessary to fully compensate for the lack of affective well-being in everyday life (Supplementary Results 1). We successfully replicated this effect in the second sample we studied during the COVID-19 pandemic (β = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.02–0.04; P < 0.001; Fig. 2c, study 2; Supplementary Table 8). At the neurobiological level, individuals with higher resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a risk phenotype for loneliness and depression , compensated best for this momentary ‘social-affective deficit’ through physical activity (β = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.01–0.26; P = 0.029; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, we observed similar benefits of physical activity at the between-individual level and related it to established psychological risk factors for mental health.
